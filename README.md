# RPS-Multiplayer
week 7 UW coding bootcamp homework

##INSTRUCTION:
* Create a game that suits this user story:

    * Only two users can play at the same time.
    * Both players pick either rock, paper or scissors. After the players make their selection, the game will tell them whether a tie occurred or if one player defeated the other.
    * The game will track each player's wins and losses.
    * Throw some chat functionality in there! No online multiplayer game is complete without having to endure endless taunts and insults from your jerk opponent.
    * Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!
    * Deploy your assignment to Github Pages.

##PSUDOCODE:
* get code from week 3 and incorporate Jquery
